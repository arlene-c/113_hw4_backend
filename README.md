My flask backend connects the frontend and external API calls. It's main endpoint is to get outfit recommendations based on the weather and user preferences. When the user presses the "get recommendation" button, the frontend sends a HTTP POST request with the following parameters: location, mood, style preference, and color preference. The backend receives the JSON, validates these inputs, and then calls the Open Weather API with the location, processing the weather data through an outfit recommendation algorithm. It then calls the Unsplash API to get images for each clothing item and combines these responses back to the frontend, which then converts the JSON string back into a Javascript object to be displayed. The backend was set up storing two API keys, one from Open Weather API and one from Unsplash API, placed in an .env file. I used a gitignore file to ensure these API keys are not displayed publicly. All API calls are kept on the backend to protect sensitive information.
